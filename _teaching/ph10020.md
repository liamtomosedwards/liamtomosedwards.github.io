The module presented core topics in Physical Sciences degree schemes and their applications. It comprised of three main parts. The first part covered translational, rotational and oscillatory motion. The second part introduced waves and the behaviour of light. Thermal physics on macroscopic and atomic scales was considered in the final section.

This description was adapted from the <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/modules/deptcurrent/PH10020/AB1/" target="_blank">university webpage</a> for this module.

As a postgraduate demonstrator, my primary role was to assist the students during weekly 2-hour tutorials where they would be given problem sheets to work through based on the topics taught in the lectures that week. I also translating various teaching materials from English to Welsh for the Welsh-language version of the module.

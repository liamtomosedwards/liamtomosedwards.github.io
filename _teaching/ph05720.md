This laboratory module gave an introduction to experimental practices in the physical sciences. Emphasis was placed on the training of students to use basic instruments, perform simple error calculations, and critically assess results in order to draw reliable conclusions. Experiments were designed to reflect theoretical topics covered in other modules - hence included experiments covering properties of matter, forces, mechanics, electricity, magnetism, and electronics. Presentational skills were also developed in the context of experiments.

This description was adapted from the <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/modules/deptcurrent/PH05720/AB1/" target="_blank">university webpage</a> for this module.

As a postgraduate demonstrator, my primary role was to assist the students with their experiments. This involved helping them with setting up the various experiments, taking measurements, analysing data, and interpreting results. I also produced teaching materials for the module in the form of an example formal report and delivering an "Introduction to Error Analysis" workshop. I also helped to mark the weekly lab diary entries from the students as well as translating various teaching materials from English to Welsh for the Welsh-language version of the module.

This laboratory module gave an introduction to experimental practices in the physical sciences. Emphasis was placed on the training of students to use basic instruments, perform simple error calculations, and critically assess results in order to draw reliable conclusions. Experiments were designed to reflect theoretical topics covered in other modules - hence included experiments covering properties of matter, forces, mechanics, electricity, magnetism, and electronics. Presentational skills were also developed in the context of experiments.

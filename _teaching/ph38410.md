This module provided an in-depth treatment of the physics of the solar atmosphere and heliosphere, including coupling between the solar wind and non-magnetised objects.

This description was adapted from the <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/modules/2023/PH38410/" target="_blank">university webpage</a> for this module.

I was given the opportunity to write and deliver a lecture providing an overview of the techniques and instruments used to take visible-light observations of the solar corona, as well as provide an overview of total solar eclipse observations of the corona.

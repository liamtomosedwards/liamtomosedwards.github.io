I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://solarphysics.aber.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Space Physics research group</a> at Aberystwyth University working on analysis of energetic electron data from the SIXS-P instrument onboard BepiColombo. My PhD involved obtaining and analysing remote sensing visible-light observations of the Sun's outer atmosphere - the corona - using a variety of different techniques including <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac54ba" target="_blank">solar rotational tomography</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-023-02231-5" target="_blank">total solar eclipses</a>. I am a fluent Welsh speaker and I am passionate about the Welsh language and my PhD is funded by a <a href="https://www.colegcymraeg.ac.uk/cy/" target="_blank">Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol</a> postgraduate research scholarship. My undergraduate degree was also done at Aberystwyth University and, after entering on the Foundation Year scheme in 2014, I graduated in the summer of 2019 with a first-class integrated Master's degree in Astrophysics.

I am deeply passionate about science communication and outreach and I have been involved in several outreach projects, written articles, and have done several radio interviews for BBC Radio Cymru. My goal is to become a physics lecturer and so teaching is something I thoroughly enjoy doing. I have been a postgraduate demonstrator for the <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/modules/deptfuture/PH15720/" target="_blank">PH15720 Laboratory Techniques for Experimental Physics</a>, <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/modules/deptfuture/PH05720/" target="_blank">PH05720 Introduction to Laboratory Physics</a>, and <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/modules/deptfuture/PH10020/AB1/" target="_blank">PH10020 Dynamics, Waves and Heat</a> modules during my PhD. I am also an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy.

When I am not working on my research or teaching, I enjoy buying books (with the intention of reading them!), playing video games, endlessly scrolling through Twitter, and watching football.

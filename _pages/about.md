I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://blogs.helsinki.fi/spacephysics/" target="_blank">Space Physics research group</a> at the University of Helsinki working on analysing energetic particle data from the SIXS-P instrument onboard BepiColombo. My undergraduate studies were at Aberystwyth University from 2014 - 2019 where I obtained a first class MPhys Astrophysics degree with honours. I also obtained my PhD from Aberystwyth University through a Research Scholarship from the <a href="https://www.colegcymraeg.ac.uk/cy/" target="_blank">Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol</a>. My PhD involved obtaining and analysing remote sensing visible-light observations of the Sun's outer atmosphere - the corona - using a variety of different techniques, including <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac54ba" target="_blank">solar rotational tomography</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-023-02231-5" target="_blank">total solar eclipses</a>. 

As a fluent Welsh speaker, I am very passionate about promoting the Welsh language. I am also deeply passionate about science communication and outreach, particularly through the medium of Welsh, and I have been involved in several outreach projects, written articles, and have done several radio interviews. My goal is to become a physics lecturer and so teaching is something I thoroughly enjoy doing. Throughout my postgraduate studies, I was a postgraduate demonstrator for several modules, namely for the <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/modules/deptfuture/PH15720/" target="_blank">PH15720 Laboratory Techniques for Experimental Physics</a>, <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/modules/deptfuture/PH05720/" target="_blank">PH05720 Introduction to Laboratory Physics</a>, and <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/modules/deptfuture/PH10020/AB1/" target="_blank">PH10020 Dynamics, Waves and Heat</a> undergraduate modules. I am also an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy upon successfully completing the <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/lteu/tpau/" target="_blank">Teaching for Postgraduates at Aberystwyth University (TPAU)</a> programme.

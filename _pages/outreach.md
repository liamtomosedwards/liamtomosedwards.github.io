I am very passionate about public outreach and I have been very fortunate to have had many experiences with a variety of different outreach activities during my studies. Here are some of the outreach activities I have been a part of:

<ul>
  <li> I was given the chance to lead my very first Welsh-medium online lecture - called "<a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/cy/undergrad/hub/sesiynaublasu/" target="_blank">Sesiwn Blasu: Astroffiseg</a>" - on how to become an astrophysicist, my research, and the relevance of A-Level physics to the world of research
</ul>

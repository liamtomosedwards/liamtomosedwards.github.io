I am very passionate about public outreach and I have been very fortunate to have had many experiences with a variety of different outreach activities during my studies. Here are some of the outreach activities I have been a part of:

<ul>
  <li> I was given the chance to lead my very first Welsh-medium online lecture - called "<a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/cy/undergrad/hub/sesiynaublasu/" target="_blank">Sesiwn Blasu: Astroffiseg</a>" - on how to become an astrophysicist, my research, and the relevance of A-Level physics to the world of research</li>
  <li>I helped organise and run a public event to showcase the <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/news/archive/2019/10/title-226763-en.html" target="_blank">transit of Mercury</a> in November 2019</li>
  <li>I was an ambassador for the <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/trio-sci-cymru/" target="_blank">Trio-Sci Cymru</a> project</li>
  <li>I have written an article for the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article/57/5/ASTROG/2738848" target="_blank">Astronomy & Geophysics</a> journal to celebrate the Royal Astronomical Society's 200th anniversary and the "Astronomy and geophysics through the traditional culture of Wales" project</li>
  <li>I have been interviewed several times by BBC Radio Cymru to discuss a variety of astrophysical topics from my research on the solar corona, total solar eclipses, black holes, exoplanets, and black holes.</li>
  <li>I wrote and delivered a lecture to around 160 school kids (12-13 year olds) at Glan-Llyn, Bala about Mars and Aberystwyth University's involvement in the ExoMars mission</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

I am always looking for opportunities to do outreach and science communication so get in touch with me if you'd like me to contribute to an event!

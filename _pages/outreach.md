I am a postgraduate researcher at the <a href="https://solarphysics.aber.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Space Physics research group</a> at Aberystwyth University. My research is focused mainly on using visible-light remote sensing observations of the atmosphere of our Sun - the corona. I am a fluent Welsh speaker and I am passionate about the Welsh language and my PhD is funded by a <a href="https://www.colegcymraeg.ac.uk/cy/" target="_blank">Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol</a> postgraduate research scholarship. My undergraduate degree was also done at Aberystwyth University and, after entering on the Foundation Year scheme in 2014, I graduated in the summer of 2019 with a first-class integrated Master's degree in Astrophysics.
